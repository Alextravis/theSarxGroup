The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with flexbox and CSS grid. 
<br>
Inspiration for this project came from my love for sarcasm and a coding prompt from codecademy.

I styled the page backwards, applying the styling I wanted to for the desktop screen sizing to the mobile sizing. I spent most of the evening fixing this problem. 
<br>
The styling changes from size to ize are set around breakpoints, not specific screen sizing.
<br>
In Conclusion
<br>
This project was a great way to cement flexbox concepts, but above that, it was a lesson in concise thought before execution. I have the tendency to jump in, but my mistakes around the styling application highlight my need for patience. 
<br>
all in all, a lot of fun!
